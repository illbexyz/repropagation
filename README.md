# Repropagation (not working yet)

Repropagation algorithm implemented in [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).

This implementation is not intended to be used in actual machine learning environments, it was just an excuse to hack with Reason while learning the algorithm.

# Usage

npm run build
```

## Build + Watch
